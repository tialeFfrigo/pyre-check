The Conexant Cx20468 audio controller is compatible with the Intel 82801FBM ICH6-M chipset, which is a part of the Intel I/O Controller Hub 6 (ICH6) family. The Intel 82801FBM ICH6-M chipset supports various features, such as PCI Express, USB 2.0, Serial ATA, and Intel High Definition Audio[^1^]. The Intel High Definition Audio specification enables high-quality audio output and input for multiple devices, such as speakers, microphones, headphones, and digital audio devices[^1^]. However, the Conexant Cx20468 audio controller uses the older AC'97 audio codec standard, which supports up to six channels of audio output and requires a separate AC-link bus to connect to the chipset[^2^]. Therefore, you need to install the Conexant Cx20468 audio driver to enable the AC-link bus and make the audio controller work properly.
 
The Conexant Cx20468 audio controller offers some advantages over the Intel High Definition Audio specification, such as lower power consumption, lower cost, and backward compatibility with older operating systems and applications[^2^]. However, it also has some limitations, such as lower sound quality, fewer audio channels, and less flexibility in configuring audio devices[^2^]. If you want to enjoy the full benefits of the Intel High Definition Audio specification on your Intel 82801FBM ICH6-M chipset, you may need to upgrade your audio controller to a compatible one.
